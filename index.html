    <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">About two decades ago, I was a senior secondary/high school student in one of the most prestigious school in my state/region/where I lived. My zeal to teach and impact young ones was inspired by my chemistry/physics teacher who I highly regarded. Her teaching methods, ability to pass message clearly, discipline, persistence to make me a better student was second to none. I want to be such an important figure/personality/teacher and make a difference in the lives of as many students/young students/people as possible. My earliest memories of teaching took me back to when I finished high school/secondary school/graduated from high school, I had the opportunity to teach a group of young students between the ages of 5years and 9years, and I appreciate the influence of teachers on the lives of young students/people. I know the names and other important information/data of all the students/young people, and was able to fast track/influence their learning process by having a close relationship with each student/child, discovering their strengths and weaknesses, and help them overcome their weaknesses because I believe all students/children have the ability to learn and I motivate/encourage them to become better.</p>
